# Important 
Salesforce dev env. provides the limited amount of the storage(5mb). Therefore don't upload big files, please(attachments in kbs should be fine).
In case of permanent failures upon persist operations - visit the next [link](https://eugene-paulavets-inter-developer-edition.ap5.force.com/AngularDemoReset), please. It execuetes the clean-up operation within the env and redirect to the web driven app variant afterwards.
